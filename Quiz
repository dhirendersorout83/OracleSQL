 Average Salary
Consider the following table named salary containing the details of employee salary of the employees in an organisation along with their department names. Find the name of the department having the maximum average salary.

Joining Date
Consider the table employee having the following columns

employee_id : storing the unique id of the employee
employee_name : storing the name of the employee
designation : storing the designation of the employee
joining_date : storing the date employee joined the organisation in YYYY-MM-DD format

Write a query to print the name of the employees in the order they joined the organisation. In case two people have joined the organisation in the same year, the person higher in the organisational heirarchy should appear first.

CEO - First level
Department Head - Second level
Regional Manager - Third level
